<u>cloud computing</u>
</h1>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the  user. </p></li></ul>
     <ul>
    <li>
     <p> cloud computing is a range of services delivered over the internet, or “the cloud.” It means using remote servers to store and access data instead of relying on local hard drives and private datacenters.
    </p></li>

         <img src="/home/vengtesh/Pictures/types-of-cloud.png" style="margin-left:500;" ></img>
    <ul>
   <li>public cloud</li>
  <li>private cloud</li>
  <li>hybrid cloud</li>
   </ul>
 
  <h1><u>public cloud</u></h1>
   <p>

Public cloud is open to all to store and access information via the Internet using the pay-per-usage method.

In public cloud, computing resources are managed and operated by the Cloud Service Provider (CSP).

Example: Amazon elastic compute cloud (EC2), IBM SmartCloud Enterprise, Microsoft, Google App Engine, Windows Azure Services Platform.
</p>
   <h1><u>private cloud</u></h1>
   <p>Private cloud is also known as an internal cloud or corporate cloud. It is used by organizations to build and manage their own data centers internally or by the third party. It can be deployed using Opensource tools such as Openstack and Eucalyptus.

Based on the location and management, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) divide private cloud into the following two parts-</p>
<ul>

  <li>  On-premise private cloud</li>
  <li>Outsourced private cloud</li>
  <h1><u>hybrid cloud</u></h1>
  <p>Hybrid cloud is partially secure because the services which are running on the public cloud can be accessed by anyone, while the services which are running on a private cloud can be accessed only by the organization's users.</p>
